🌍 Global Data Access Platform (Early Stage)

An early-stage startup building simple, transparent access to cross‑border financial data.

This repository documents the startup journey, not just the code. It is written so visitors can quickly understand what we are building, why it matters, and how they can support it.

🚀 What Problem Are We Solving?

Access to financial and market data is:

Fragmented across countries

Expensive or restricted

Hard for small developers and researchers to use

As a result, global investing and analysis is biased toward a few regions.

We aim to change that by starting with data, not money.

🧭 What Are We Building?

A platform that:

Aggregates structured financial data across regions

Exposes it through a clean, developer‑friendly API

Allows users to simulate investments (no real money)

Grows transparently and responsibly

This is infrastructure, not a trading app.

🧪 Current Stage (v0)

What exists today:

A real dashboard (overview, data, API, simulator)

User accounts and usage tracking

Early data models and API structure

What does not exist yet:

Real‑money trading

Monetization

Institutional partnerships

This is intentional.

🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js (TypeScript)

Backend: API‑first architecture

Auth: Token‑based authentication

Database: PostgreSQL (in progress)

Deployment: Vercel

The stack may evolve and will be documented openly.

🤝 How You Can Support
