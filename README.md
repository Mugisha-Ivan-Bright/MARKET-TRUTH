# 🌍 Global Data Access Platform

> **Early-stage startup building simple and transparent access to cross-border financial data.**

---

## ❓ What Is This?

This project is an **early-stage startup**.

We are building a platform that makes it easier to **access, compare, and experiment with financial data across countries** — starting with data and simulations, not real money.

This repository documents the **journey**, not just the code.

---

## 🚀 The Problem

Today, financial and market data is:

* Fragmented across borders
* Expensive or locked behind institutions
* Hard for small developers, students, and researchers to access

This makes global analysis and investing unfair and limited.

---

## 💡 Our Idea

We are building a platform that:

* Aggregates financial data from multiple regions
* Exposes it through a clean, developer-friendly API
* Allows users to run **investment simulations** (no real money)
* Grows slowly, transparently, and responsibly

👉 This is **data infrastructure**, not a trading app.

---

## 🧪 Current Stage — v0

### What Exists

* A real dashboard (Overview, Data, API, Simulator)
* User accounts and basic profiles
* Usage tracking (API calls, activity)
* Early data models and API structure

### What Does NOT Exist (Yet)

* Real-money transactions
* Monetization
* Institutional partnerships

This is intentional for safety and focus.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Next.js (TypeScript)
* **Backend:** API-first architecture
* **Authentication:** Token-based (JWT / Supabase-style)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (in progress)
* **Deployment:** Vercel

The stack may evolve and will be documented openly.

## 🧑‍💻 Founder

Built by a software engineering student focused on:

* Systems and infrastructure
* Long-term, real-world impact
* Learning by building real products

This started as a learning project and is growing into something serious.

---

## 🗺 Roadmap (High Level)

* **v0:** Core platform, simulation, API skeleton
* **v1:** Real datasets, developer onboarding
* **v2:** Advanced analytics and broader access

---

## ⚖️ Disclaimer

This platform:

* Does **not** provide financial advice
* Does **not** execute trades
* Is a **data and simulation platform only**
